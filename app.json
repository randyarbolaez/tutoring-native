    "description": "Have you ever needed help with a subject in college but couldn’t find a tutor? This app solves that problem! With people posting their information and what subject they’re good at. The app doesn’t have pages(routes), it’s just modals, I think the UI is cleaner and and the code is easier to read as well. I also implanted the search feature, I was going to use a library but decided against it so I can learn. https://github.com/randyarbolaez/tutoring-native",
